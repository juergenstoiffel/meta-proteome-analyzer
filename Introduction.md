## Introduction ##
**MetaProteomeAnalyzer (MPA)** is a stand-alone platform-independent application written in Java and developed at [Max Planck Institute for Dynamics of Complex Technical Systems Magdeburg/Germany](http://www.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de).

The software provides an easy-to-use graphical user interface for processing and interpretation of tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS) metaproteomics data.

The basic spectrum input format for MetaProteomeAnalyzer is the MASCOT Generic Format (MGF). MGF files are generated by most common mass spectrometric software applications.

**NOTE:** In case of not having access to the MGF file format (e.g. RAW format only), please have a look at the [ProteoWizard toolsuite](http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net) for conversion of MS/MS spectra.

The software is being maintained by
